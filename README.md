# Generic Search Agent

This repo contains an implementation of the Generic Search Problem based on the pseudocode of Russel and Norvig in their book, __Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach__.

Our implementation provides an interface which can be used to solve any specific search problem. Using any of the following search tree traversal techniques:-

* Bread-First Search
* Depth-First Search
* Depth-Limited Search
* Iterative Deepening
* Uniform Cost Search
* Greedy Search
* A* Search

This repo also contains a grid traversal agent based on the plot of the movie, __Avengers: Endgame__.  Iron Man represents the agent which needs to defeat Thanos by collecting the six Infinity Stones first. The detailed description of the problem can be found in `project_requirements.pdf`. And a thorough analysis and description of our implementation can be found in `report.pdf`.
